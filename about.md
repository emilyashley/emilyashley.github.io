Hi! I'm Emily Ashley. I live in New Orleans (via Houston). I spent the last few years working in community development and volunteer management. I really dig utilizing my urban studies & economics background to lead tactical volunteer projects. Pretty awesome to organize and design projects where 100+ people directly improve quality of life in a neighborhood. I’m not just talking murals; I mean reopening parks and renovating public school libraries.  

I'm a long-standing fangirl of guerrilla urbanism, shared spaces, public art, and collaborative volunteer efforts. I've been exploring the growing number of technological approaches to solving civic problems. Curious about emerging open geospatial technologies available to community members, I attended the OpenStreetMap conference last summer and was rewarded ten-fold. I fell headfirst into a brilliant community and began exploring an ever-developing list of Python, R, and Javascript libraries. Turns out there's an open-source geo-spatial industry. And HOLY COW it’s awesome. 

So now, I'm working on understanding, using, and sharing these amazing tools. I founded the New Orleans chapter of Maptime and organize it's events with the talented Matt Toups. Maptime creates a monthly space for mapping tutorials, workshops, ongoing projects with a shared goal, and independent/collaborative work time. We provide an open learning environment for all levels, offering intentional educational support for the beginner and utilizing free, open mapping tools and technologies. 

On the side, I go exploring neighborhoods, historic highways, and main streets in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Southeastern Texas. Ingressing, geo-caching, benchmarking, instagraming, u-turning, seeking dead-ends, and occasionally getting the car stuck. US-90 is one of my favorites!  Historical geography, urban morphology, and demographics are my jam; those spatiotemporal patterns make my heart go thump.

TL;DR: I like maps, people, javascript, and open-source technologies. I'm currently a full-time Software Engineering student at Hack Reactor and will be seeking opportunities for employment in June.
